# Chapter 1: Battery Board Preintegration
In this chapter, the user will learn the proper steps to assemble an Electrical Power System (EPS) board. The steps can be followed again to create an optional ballast to add weight to the satellite, or while not recommended, additional power to the satellite.

<span style="color:red">***Before continuing:** it is important to note that gloves should be worn when soldering and it should be done in a well-ventilated area to avoid the harmful fumes.*</span>


## Soldering the Relay
<div class="result" markdown>
1. Insert the relay from the top side as seen in Figure 1.1
2. The Relay on the EPS board has through hole connections that will need to be soldered to on the bottom side as seen in Figure 1.2
3. After Soldering, use the flush cutters to cut the leads from the relay and try to get relay solder joints as flush to the board as possible as seen in Figure 1.3

## Soldering the Battery Holders
<div class="result" markdown>
1. Insert the battery holders into the board as seen in Figure 1.4
2. Solder the through hole battery terminals on the top side of the EPS as seen in Figure 1.5
</div>

## **OPTIONAL**: Ballast Board creation
<div class="result" markdown>
1. Follow all of the prior steps to create a secondary EPS
2. If additional power is desired for the satellite, a wire can be soldered to the Pack+ Test point between both boards, and a wire can be soldered to the B- Test point between both boards.

## Check your work
If all steps were followed correctly, the EPS should appear as it does in Figure 1.6.
