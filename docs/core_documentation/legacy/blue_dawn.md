# The 2021 Blue Dawn Hackathon
Early 2021 was a facinating moment in time. We were still in the height of the pandemic and running our entire lives out of virtual spaces like Discord. A group of us in the Blue Dot Consortium decided it would be really cool to run a virtual CubeSat Hackathon and we actually did it! 

We did a series of virtual workshops led by the top members of our student teams at the time to give people a quick introduction to all things CubeSats.
