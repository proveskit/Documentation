# Chapter 8: Integration Procedure

## 1) Building the Cube
### a. Initial Structure Assembly
  - **i.** For this part of the integration, you will need two Main “U” halves, four small L-shaped brackets, and stainless steel 5mm long M2.5 Button Head fasteners. 
    ![Figure 8-1](images/8-1.jpg)
    <p align="center">Fig 8.1: Main structure components</p>
!!! note
    It is extremely important that the button head fasteners are used in this step and NOT the pan head fasteners for the L Brackets as this will allow the Solar Boards to fit on top of the fasteners. 
  - **ii.** Loosely attach the two halves together using the four L-brackets and 5mm fasteners as shown in figure 8.1 below. Ensure not to over-tighten as we will “square up” the structure later using a jig.
![Figure 8-2](images/8-2.jpg)
    <p align="center">Figure 8.2: Example of how to attach the L brackets to initial structure assembly.</p>
!!! warning
    Make sure to ALWAYS screw in the fasteners horizontally when dealing with pre-installed pem-nuts.
  - **iii.** If you happen to pop out one of the pem-nuts, secure the fasteners with locknuts but be extra careful not to tighten them too much.

!!! warning
    TORQUE SPEC IS 0.59 N-M (5.22 IN-LB), DO NOT EXCEED THIS ON M2.5 BOLTS/FASTENERS.

## 2) Card Brackets & Battery Board
### a. Initial bracket mounting.
  - **i.** Secure 2 battery board card brackets onto the board using M2.5x5mm Pan Head bolts as shown in Figure 8.3 below.

    <p align="center">Figure 8.3: Initial Card Bracket Mount to Battery Board</p>
  - **ii.** There are two separate approaches to this next step:
    1. Angle the board diagonally with attached brackets and insert into the internal volume of the main structure. Use the board mounting holes on the main structure to secure the battery board using M2.5x5mm pan head bolts. There are several mounting hole options through the vertical length of the structure although the two holes extend further to the bottom on each corner of the structure should be reserved for mounting the feet.  **Figure 8.4**

    <p align="center">Figure 8.4: Approach 1 of Installing Battery Board Inside Structure</p>
    
    2. The second approach to inserting the battery board would be taking the Structure Halves apart and inserting the board along with any additional boards (battery board(s), development boards, payloads, etc.) into one of the Half U’s. Once the board is inserted, the holes on the bracket is aligned with the structure and fastened with the M2.5x5 Pan Head fasteners. The other Half U can be brought back in and installed like in the Building the Cube step, and the remaining bracket holes can be mounted to the structure.  **Figure 8.5**

### b. Applying Thermocouple
  - **i.** Apply space-rated glue to the Thermocouple and place it on the side of one of the two middle batteries. Make sure that the metal part of the thermocouple is touching the battery casing.

### c. Applying Thermal Blanket
  - **i.** Place strips of double-sided Kapton tape along the face of the batteries and press the thermal blanket down against the exposed tape.

  - **ii.** Fold the ends back against the outer-facing side of the thermal blanket.

## 3) Integrating Satellite Feet
### a. Installing Feet Assembly
  - **i.** Use Blue Loctite, M2.5x10mm pan head fasteners, and M2.5 locknuts to install the feet.
  - **ii.** Install the feet so the feet with the switches inside them are all diagonal from one another.
  ![Figure 8-9](images/8-9.png)
    <p align="center">Figure 8.9: Placement of Foot Switches on structure layout</p>
  - **iii.** To install the feet on the structure, place locknuts in the small openings of the feet as shown in Figure 8.10 with the nylon side of the locknut facing towards the interior of the satellite. Press downwards on the top of the feet while also pressing them up against the side of the structure.
  ![Figure 8-10](images/8-10.png)
    <p align="center">Figure 8.10: Feet with switch assembly</p>
  - **iv.** Dip the ends of the 10mm long fasteners in Loctite and secure the feet in place.
    ![Figure 8-11](images/8-11.png)
    <p align="center">Figure 8.11: The two different feet installed in structure</p>

## 4) Squaring the Satellite
### a. It’s Jig Time!
- Place the structure into the jig as shown in figure 8.11. Slide it back and forth multiple times through the jig to square up the structure.

!!! note
    If you cannot fit the satellite into the jig, loosen the fasteners on the structure (not including the feet) and attempt to fit it again.

![Figure 8-12](images/8-12.png)

- Without taking the satellite out, unscrew fasteners one at a time and secure them by dipping them in Blue Loctite and placing them back in the structure. Be careful with the fasteners that are screwed into the small L brackets.
