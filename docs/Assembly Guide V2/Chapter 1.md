# Chapter 1: Battery Board Assembly
In this chapter, the user will learn the proper steps to assemble an Electrical Power System (EPS) board. The steps can be followed again to create an optional ballast to add weight to the satellite, or while not recommended, additional power to the satellite.

<span style="color:red">***Before continuing:** it is important to note that gloves should be worn when soldering and it should be done in a well-ventilated area to avoid the harmful fumes.*</span>


## Soldering the Relay
1. Align the relay onto the white box by the top left corner of the battery board. Make sure the dot on the top side of the relay is closest to the slot hole as seen as figure 1.1

2. The Relay on the EPS board has through hole connections that will need to be soldered to on the bottom side as seen in Figure 1.2

3. The sodering should not be flush to the board,rather there should be enough so that the relay will be allowed to lay on it's side. This can be seen in figure 1.3 and is also stated on the board.

   ## Soldering the Battery Holders

1. Insert the battery holders into the board as seen in Figure 1.4

2. Solder the through hole battery terminals on the top side of the EPS as seen in Figure 1.5

## **OPTIONAL**: Ballast Board creation
<div class="result" markdown>
1. Follow all of the prior steps to create a secondary EPS
2. If additional power is desired for the satellite, a wire can be soldered to the Pack+ Test point between both boards, and a wire can be soldered to the B- Test point between both boards.

## Check your work
If all steps were followed correctly, the EPS should appear as it does in Figure 1.6. (notwe that this should show both the front and back)
