# Why PROVES? 
When designing the PROVES kit we wanted to emphasize a few things:

- **Simplicity**
- **Affordability**
- **Accessibility**

When designing the PROVES 1U CubeSat Kit we wanted to remove as much complexity as possible from the design. This is mainly due to the pains that we experienced when working with PyCubed based satellites like BroncoSat-1, Pleiades - Yearling 1, and QubeSat from UC Berkeley. Having to deal with a rats nest of wires and hundreds of pages of assembly documentation not only seriously slows down the integration process, but also introduces way more potential points of error.
