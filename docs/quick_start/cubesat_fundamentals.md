# Foundational Info About CubeSats

So this is your first time ever getting into CubeSats, welcome! This page contains a list of resources that are useful for understanding the CubeSat community and developing a foundational understanding of the space we work in. 

## CubeSat 101

## Our Favorite CubeSat Missions!

    In our opinion the ELFIN mission from UCLA is the shining example for what is possible with a university led scientific CubeSat mission. As a pair of 3U CubeSats, this mission generated remarkable scientific data from deployment all the way until deorbit. 

    Check out their website [here!](https://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu)
    And read their mission summary paper [here.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-020-00721-7)

    The Seahawk-1 CubeSat from UNCW is an amazing example of how small satellites can have big impacts! Ocean color is a remarkable but rather niche field of scientific inquiry. As a result, it is difficult to fund dedicated satellite missions to collect high resolution ocean color data. The SOCON mission demonstrated that it was possible ot use these shoebox sized satellites to collect useful scientific data far beyond what the current state of the art is.

## The Other Open Source CubeSat Architectures

#### The PyCubed
The PyCubed architecture was developed by the man, the myth, the legend, Max Holliday while he was a Ph.D student at Stanford University. Since it was announced to the world at the SmallSat 2019 the PyCubed took the world by storm with the promise of being an easy to use and very low cost solution for CubeSat avionics. 

#### OreSat
The OreSat architecture has been in development one way or another since the founding of the Portland State Aerospace Society in 1996! They have a really cool modular card cage system. Today it has sucessfully been to space once on OreSat-0 and will be flying again soon on OreSat-0.5!
