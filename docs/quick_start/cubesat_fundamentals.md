## The Other Open Source CubeSat Architectures

#### The PyCubed
The PyCubed architecture was developed by the man, the myth, the legend, Max Holliday while he was a Ph.D student at Stanford University. Since it was announced to the world at the SmallSat 2019 the PyCubed took the world by storm with the promise of being an easy to use and very low cost solution for CubeSat avionics. 

#### OreSat
The OreSat architecture has been in development one way or another since the founding of the Portland State Aerospace Society in 1996! They have a really cool modular card cage system. Today it has sucessfully been to space once on OreSat-0 and will be flying again soon on OreSat-0.5!
