### How to use GitHub
!!! Tip "First Time Using GitHub?"
    If this is your first time using GitHub, we highly recommend checking out the [GitHub Skills Page](https://skills.github.com)

GitHub is our preferred method of version control. Once you've been added to (or have forked) one of our repositories the procedure for making contributions is pretty straightforward! 

1. **Step 1:** Check into your new branch. 
2. **Step 2:** Edit the files on your branch with whatever new contributions you would like to make! 
3. **Step 3:** Use commits like a manual "save" button. Whenever you are making a change that you think needs a quicksave point make a new commit! 
4. **Step 4:** When you're done making new contributions make a pull request back to the main branch of the repository! One of the responsible engineers for that repo will then review the request to make sure everything looks good, and if it is ready to rock and roll they will merge it.
