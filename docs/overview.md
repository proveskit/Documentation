# A PROVES Kit Overview
The PROVES Kit blends Open-Source Hardware and Software. The Hardware developed includes the entire educational satellite structure, brackets, and printed circuit boards. One of the major issues that we sought to solve with the kit was to develop a single solution for an end to end space mission engineering education. Many other open source projects avalible to the community only feature a single element, like just a radio or just a flight computer.
