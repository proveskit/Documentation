# Welcome to the PROVES Kit!
The Pleiades Rapid Orbital Verification Experiment System (PROVES) 1U kit is intended as an education first option for members of academia and industry who look to be first time or returning CubeSat developers.

## Overview of the PROVES Kit
Hey you! You’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border into CubeSats too weren’t you? Walked right into all the complexities and costs and wondering what even is a quasi-static load? Just like those guys over there.

We were right where you were not too long ago. As founding members of Bronco Space at Cal Poly Pomona we started our journey into the land of CubeSats as a group of extremely naive undergrads in Spring of 2019. We wanted to bring something with our names on it and get it to outer space by 2022, whatever it took. How hard could it be? 

Well, it turned out to be the most difficult thing that any of us had ever undertaken in our entire lives. Maybe even the hardest thing ever done at our university in all time. We had to fight against a complete lack of institutional knowledge or support, a complete lack of funding, and a global pandemic to get our first satellite BroncoSat-1 to orbit in May of 2022. Overcoming all of that just for it to not work. Dead on arrival, not even a peep. By then our little student club had managed to carve out an existing as a small lab at Cal Poly Pomona, and soon we had NASA backed instruments and many more satellites in development. We bet the farm on BroncoSat-1 and it still worked out despite the on-orbit failure, but it could have very easily gone the other way and been the end of our dreams of space.  

This is what inspired us to dream of a world where the CubeSat developer never has to wonder whether or not their satellite will work. They would only have to ask “how well will my satellite work.” The PROVES CubeSat Kit is just the beginning of how we are planning to make this world a reality.
